--- 2.2.1 --------------------------------------------

- Materials have been changed to have roughness and
  metallic parameters instead ambient, specular and shininess.
  Handling of more texture types have been added.
  Brdf emulation with background images when rendering materials
  and using camera light or scene lights.

  Image planes or background images used to set a diffuse
  texture and set emission to white. That doesn't work any more
  because a white emission material will overexpose the texture.

  Set the background texture as an emission texture instead will
  get the same result as in previous wings versions. New image
  plane will do this automatically. [dgud]

- Added new image commands to the outliner.
  - Create image from channel, to enable usage of single channels from example
    combined metallic roughness textures.
  - Invert channel, create a new image with one channel
    (or image in case of gray scale) inverted.
  To be used for example to change between DirectX and OpenGL normal map
  formats, or to create a simple roughness map from a metallic map. [dgud]

- Added a test version of Boolean commands.
  Does not handle coplanar faces.
  Try subdividing the intersecting faces if the Boolean commands doesn't
  work. [dgud]
